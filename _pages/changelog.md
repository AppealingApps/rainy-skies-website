### `Latest`
# **Version 1.0.3**
Ahoy, app aficionados! This update is jam-packed with fixes and tweaks. Let's dive into the changes:

Fixes:
- We've mastered the art of instant weather metamorphosis. Toggle those temperature units, and watch the numbers change faster than our Michigan weather.
- Fixed selecting hours on the hourly detail screen now changes the info data properly ‚Äì It was a bit like trying to teach a cat to fetch. But fear not, the hourly details now obey your taps like a well-trained butler.
- Fixed free version location limit alert now shows up at the right time and ISN'T IN ALL CAPS ‚Äì We realized the alert was shouting at you like an overexcited sports commentator. It's now speaking in a more civilized lowercase tone.
- Fix weather pull date ‚Äì Our weather pull date footer has been a bit of a time traveler itself, jumping back and forth. Apologies for any confusion; we've grounded it and sorted out its timeline issues.
- Fix the "Member Since" date text for subscribers ‚Äì It turns out, our app was a little confused about its age. It's not Benjamin Button; we've corrected the "Member Since" date to reflect your subscription's true age.

So there you have it, brave users! This update is like a magician's hat‚Äîfull of fixes, surprises, and maybe even a rabbit or two. Keep enjoying the app, and remember, if you find any more quirks, consider them part of the charm. Stay quirky!

And of course, your dad joke for this update:

My wife said I should do lunges to stay in shape...

...
That would be a big step forward!

### `Previously`
# **Version 1.0.2**
Hey there, fearless app explorers! We're back with our first little app update, and this one's all about your senses. Get ready to feel the app like never before.

##### Features:
- Your hands just got a new best friend. Feel the loading, errors, and taps with a touch of style. It's like a virtual handshake every time you use the app.
- We've set your widgets free! They're like little weather detectives now, gathering their own info. No more relying on the weather app to spill the beans.

##### Fixes:
We squashed some bugs, and the results are both beautiful and a little quirky.
- The current weather widget was acting up, but they're back in business now. No more sudden weather widget meltdowns.
- We're using location coordinates so fuzzy, they're almost cuddly. Be aware that this update will invalidate all your existing caches.

We've fixed up the UI a little bit, to make things just a little bit fresher.
- Fixed the dew point chart not scrolling ‚Äì It was more stuck than a lollipop in summer. Now, it flows like a river.
- Fixed bottom padding of weather ad when it wasn't on screen ‚Äì Padding is great, but let's not get carried away. We've fixed it so it stays where it's supposed to.
- Don't show refreshing UI when no refresh is needed ‚Äì No more fake refreshes.
- We used to be a bit forgetful when we last checked the weather at the bottom of the weather screen. Now we're spot on, like a well-trained golden retriever.

##### Performance Improvements ‚Äî It's like trading your bike for a rocket.

So there you have it, folks. This update is all about feeling the vibes, making things look right, and performing like a champ. Enjoy the sensory journey, and as always, keep those feature requests and bug reports coming. We love hearing from you, even if it's to say, "Hey, your app is the best thing since sliced bread." Stay sensational!

Oh yeah, and here's your dad joke for this update:

Why don't skeletons fight each other?
