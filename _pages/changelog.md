### `Latest`
# **Version 1.0.2**
Hey there, fearless app explorers! We're back with our first little app update, and this one's all about your senses. Get ready to feel the app like never before.

##### Features:
- Your hands just got a new best friend. Feel the loading, errors, and taps with a touch of style. It's like a virtual handshake every time you use the app.
- We've set your widgets free! They're like little weather detectives now, gathering their own info. No more relying on the weather app to spill the beans.

##### Fixes:
We squashed some bugs, and the results are both beautiful and a little quirky.
- The current weather widget was acting up, but they're back in business now. No more sudden weather widget meltdowns.
- We're using location coordinates so fuzzy, they're almost cuddly. Be aware that this update will invalidate all your existing caches.

We've fixed up the UI a little bit, to make things just a little bit fresher.
- Fixed the dew point chart not scrolling ‚Äì It was more stuck than a lollipop in summer. Now, it flows like a river.
- Fixed bottom padding of weather ad when it wasn't on screen ‚Äì Padding is great, but let's not get carried away. We've fixed it so it stays where it's supposed to.
- Don't show refreshing UI when no refresh is needed ‚Äì No more fake refreshes.
- We used to be a bit forgetful when we last checked the weather at the bottom of the weather screen. Now we're spot on, like a well-trained golden retriever.

##### Performance Improvements ‚Äî It's like trading your bike for a rocket.

So there you have it, folks. This update is all about feeling the vibes, making things look right, and performing like a champ. Enjoy the sensory journey, and as always, keep those feature requests and bug reports coming. We love hearing from you, even if it's to say, "Hey, your app is the best thing since sliced bread." Stay sensational!

Oh yeah, and here's your dad joke for this update:

Why don't skeletons fight each other?

Because they don't have the guts!
