### <a name="roadmap"></a>[`Roadmap`](#roadmap)
# <a name="1.2.0"></a>**[Version 1.2.0](#1.2.0)**
##### Highlighted Changes
* A revamped hourly data type picker. That's a really long name for the menu that lets you pick what kind of hourly data you're looking at, like "temperature" or "precipitation chance". That whole menu has been given a makeover to make it quicker to use and totally customizable. (Silver subscription required)
* You might notice a little toggle next to the minutely precipitation chart the next time its raining. You can now see the percent chance of rain over the next hour too! (Silver subscription required)
* Current weather has been given a bit of a glow-up. You can now swipe on the mini data blocks to see more. Press and hold on them to get to the settings menu and customize away. (Silver subscription required)
* Notifications! Maybe that idea doesn't excite you yet, but give it a whirl. It has probably been one of the most difficult features to get right, but also one that's been far more useful than even I would have thought! You can get summary notifications for today and tomorrows weather, and alerts when severe weather is entering your area. (Silver subscription required)

##### Other New Features
* If you come back to the app after a while, we'll deposit you at the top of the weather screen.
* After you've been using the app for a bit, we'll ask how you're feeling about the app. You have no idea how much a good review means.

##### Bug Fixes
* Adjusted how weather alerts look on the weather screen so they'll show their full title more often.
* It felt a bit odd that the icon for snow was a snowflake, but the icon for rain was clouds and rain. Now the icon for snow is clouds and snow to match.
* When you'd open weather alert information, there was a weird visual glitch at the bottom of the web view. That's been polished off.
* The bar on the side would show "cloudy" (gray color), even when it was mostly sunny outside. Fixed!

##### What's Next
It's summer time where I am. That means vacations and new iOS announcement season. The next update of Rainy Skies will aim for the fall when the next version of iOS releases. I hope you all have a safe and blessed summer (or whatever season you are in)!

And, finally...

What’s a ghost’s favorite summer treat?

I-scream!

Not much new here, just a little housecleaning!

##### Bug Fixes
* Fixed a bug with the next-hour precipitation chart. It would always show extremely light rain, even during a storm. Our attempts to change the weather failed, so we'll return to showing you what's happening out your window.
* Fixed a bug with the tip jar where the image would load and then load again.

### `Previously`
# <a name="1.1.0"></a>**[Version 1.1.0](#1.1.0)**
##### Highlighted Changes
* New Free App Icon “Bold White” — We’ve introduced a fresh app icon that’s bolder than a banana trying to impress its peel. It’s so white that it makes snowflakes jealous. Plus, it’s free! 
* Locations Sync Between Devices — Your weather preferences are now more synchronized than a perfectly choreographed rain dance.
* iPad Split View: Weather and Locations — It’s like having a meteorologist and a GPS navigator co-hosting a reality show. Tune in for the drama!
* “What’s New” Screen — We’ve added a “What’s New” screen because everyone deserves a little suspense in their weather app experience. It’s like opening a fortune cookie, but instead of lucky numbers, you get juicy app updates. Spoiler alert: It’s all about the weather (and maybe a sprinkle of magic).
* Custom Widget Locations — Widgets now let you set custom locations. Want to know the weather at the North Pole? Done. Curious about conditions on Mars? Well...we can't do that...yet.

##### Other Changes
* Paywall Upgrade: Now with Pizzazz! — Our paywall has undergone a transformation. It’s no longer a dull toll booth; it’s a glittering gateway to premium features.
* Settings Screen Shuffle — We reorganized the settings screen like a game of musical chairs. It’s sleeker, snazzier, and more intuitive.
* Subscription Sleuth Mode — We’re now Sherlock Holmes for subscriptions. If we suspect you’ve subscribed, we’ll discreetly investigate. Expect a polite inquiry: “Excuse me, dear user, do you have a subscription? Mind if we restore it on your new device?” Elementary, my dear Watson.
* Dot-Dot-Who's-There? — New app icons now wear a tiny dot until you give them attention. It’s like they’re saying, “Hey, I’m here! Look at me!” Treat them kindly; they’re sensitive. And remember, every time you ignore an icon, a pixel sheds a tear.

##### Bug Fixes
* Chart Bugs Squashed — Our charts were acting glitchier than a robot doing the cha-cha. But fear not! We’ve debugged them faster than a caffeine-fueled programmer during a hackathon. Now your weather graphs are smoother than a jazz sax solo.
* Weather Alerts: No More Hide-and-Seek — Weather alerts were playing peekaboo, hiding from the screen like mischievous sprites. We’ve scolded them and put them back where they belong. Now you’ll know about storms, rainbows, and unicorn sightings in real-time.
* Farewell, “Location 1” Mystery
* Various other bits and bobs

Remember, our app is like a weather wizard’s spellbook—full of surprises, enchantments, and occasional hiccups. Enjoy the updates, and may your forecasts be as accurate as a cat predicting rain (which is to say, not very). Happy weather-watching!

Happy Holidays! The only new item in this update is a Christmas 2023 app icon for subscribed users. I have some great new updates in the works that I think you'll really love. Best of wishes to you and your families during this holiday season, and I'm praying for a wonderful new year for all of you.

And, of course, here's your joke of the update!

How much did Santa pay for his sleigh?

Nothing. It was on the house.

# <a name="1.0.3"></a>**[Version 1.0.3](#1.0.3)**
Ahoy, app aficionados! This update is jam-packed with fixes and tweaks. Let's dive into the changes:

Fixes:
- We've mastered the art of instant weather metamorphosis. Toggle those temperature units, and watch the numbers change faster than our Michigan weather.
- Fixed selecting hours on the hourly detail screen now changes the info data properly – It was a bit like trying to teach a cat to fetch. But fear not, the hourly details now obey your taps like a well-trained butler.
- Fixed free version location limit alert now shows up at the right time and ISN'T IN ALL CAPS – We realized the alert was shouting at you like an overexcited sports commentator. It's now speaking in a more civilized lowercase tone.
- Fix weather pull date – Our weather pull date footer has been a bit of a time traveler itself, jumping back and forth. Apologies for any confusion; we've grounded it and sorted out its timeline issues.
- Fix the "Member Since" date text for subscribers – It turns out, our app was a little confused about its age. It's not Benjamin Button; we've corrected the "Member Since" date to reflect your subscription's true age.

So there you have it, brave users! This update is like a magician's hat—full of fixes, surprises, and maybe even a rabbit or two. Keep enjoying the app, and remember, if you find any more quirks, consider them part of the charm. Stay quirky!

And of course, your dad joke for this update:

My wife said I should do lunges to stay in shape...
...

...
That would be a big step forward!

# <a name="1.0.2"></a>**[Version 1.0.2](#1.0.2)**
Hey there, fearless app explorers! We're back with our first little app update, and this one's all about your senses. Get ready to feel the app like never before.

##### Features:
- Your hands just got a new best friend. Feel the loading, errors, and taps with a touch of style. It's like a virtual handshake every time you use the app.
- We've set your widgets free! They're like little weather detectives now, gathering their own info. No more relying on the weather app to spill the beans.

##### Fixes:
We squashed some bugs, and the results are both beautiful and a little quirky.
- The current weather widget was acting up, but they're back in business now. No more sudden weather widget meltdowns.
- We're using location coordinates so fuzzy, they're almost cuddly. Be aware that this update will invalidate all your existing caches.

We've fixed up the UI a little bit, to make things just a little bit fresher.
- Fixed the dew point chart not scrolling – It was more stuck than a lollipop in summer. Now, it flows like a river.
- Fixed bottom padding of weather ad when it wasn't on screen – Padding is great, but let's not get carried away. We've fixed it so it stays where it's supposed to.
- Don't show refreshing UI when no refresh is needed – No more fake refreshes.
- We used to be a bit forgetful when we last checked the weather at the bottom of the weather screen. Now we're spot on, like a well-trained golden retriever.

##### Performance Improvements — It's like trading your bike for a rocket.

So there you have it, folks. This update is all about feeling the vibes, making things look right, and performing like a champ. Enjoy the sensory journey, and as always, keep those feature requests and bug reports coming. We love hearing from you, even if it's to say, "Hey, your app is the best thing since sliced bread." Stay sensational!

Oh yeah, and here's your dad joke for this update:

Why don't skeletons fight each other?

Because they don't have the guts!

The initial release of the app! Has the weather screen, supports Apple Weather, looks pretty good 😏
