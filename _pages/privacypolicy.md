# Rainy Skies Privacy Policy
Your privacy is critically important to us. Because I don't need to know any personal information, I don't collect any personal information. Rainy Skies is designed from the ground up to preserve your privacy.

Rainy Skies can display some of your personal information (your location) within the app. This is handled through standard Apple platform privacy prompts. Your information does not leave your device, with the following exceptions:

1. Your location is sent along with weather data requests. This is required for the functionality of the app and is covered by Apple Weather's [privacy policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/weather/).

If you e-mail me for support, I have access to your e-mail address and any information you include in your e-mail. No other personal data leaves your device. 

I collect anonymous telemetry data about your usage of the application. No information will ever be linked back to you or your personal information. This anonymous data is shared with my telemetry provider ([TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy/)).

Additional non-personally identifiable data will be kept if you sign-up for a Rainy Skies subscription. Your billing information, address, and name are all maintained by the App Store and are not visible to me. I will get information about whether or not you have purchased a subscription, the term you signed up for, and when it is due to expire. This is all made available to me in an anonymous fashion. This anonymous data is also shared with my purchase provider ([RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/dpa)).

## Personally Identifying Information
Rainy Skies does not gather or transmit any Personally-Identifying Information outside of your local device. 

## Business Transfers
If Rainy Skies, Appealing Apps LLC, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Appealing Apps LLC goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, this policy and its effects may change or be amended. (As Rainy Skies does not collect any information about you there is very little effect this would likely have in practice.)

## Privacy Policy Changes
Although most changes are likely to be minor, Rainy Skies may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at Appealing Apps LLC's sole discretion. Your continued use of this app after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

## Indemnity
You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in settlement of a claim or dispute on the advice of our legal advisers) incurred or suffered by us arising out of use of this app or any breach by you of any provision of these terms of use, or arising out of any claim that you have breached any provision of these terms of use.
